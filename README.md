## Overview of the analysis
Now that we've gotten a good idea of how to create our story, there is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

## Results:
1) Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

2) Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

3) Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Summary:

The analysis unambiguously showed that the majority of bike users are men. They also predominate in the subscription.
Based on this, you can focus on men's bikes and direct advertising to women to attract them.
The most peak time is from 4 to 7 AM,  and less from 2 to 4 PM (at this time it is best to organize repairs and organizational work).
